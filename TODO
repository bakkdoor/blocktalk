# TODO for v0.1: #
##################

- better support for chained method calls, similar to Smalltalk
- finish support for named arguments (done)
  - also add support for calling standard ruby methods with more than one argument
- add optimizations, when possible
- add more documentation & enhance standard library (as much as possible in Blocktalk itself)
- add real support for System#require (be able to load Ruby & Blocktalk code)

ideas: 
------
