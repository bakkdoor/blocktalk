# TODO for v0.1: #
##################

- better support for chained method calls, similar to Smalltalk
- finish support for named arguments
- add optimizations, when possible
- add more documentation & enhance standard library (as much as possible in Blocktalk itself)
- add real support for System#require (be able to load Ruby & Blocktalk code)

ideas: 
------
- maybe add a ruby keyword & allow inline ruby code inside it (for std-lib)
  -> e.g.: %ruby{
             # inline ruby code here
           }
  (another, more simple way would be to simply use strings & Kernel::eval, 
   but this might not work as well with editors etc.)
